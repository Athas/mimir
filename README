Description
===========

Mimir is an extensible IRC bot written in shell script.  It uses
[ii][ii] as the IRC backend.  The source code is intended to be very
short and hackable.

As of this writing, Mimir only supports being on a single channel on a
single IRC server, although there is nothing preventing you from
running multiple Mimir instances that share the same state database.

Technical overview
------------------

The bot consists of two independent subprograms: mimir_irc, which sets
up the connection to the IRC server (basically just invoking ii and
joining the channel, although arbitrary commands can be inserted), and
mimir proper, which reads and writes to the files created by ii.  This
means that the bot can be modified (or crash) without affecting the
connection to the IRC server.

Mimir reacts to channel messages of the form 'mimirbot_name: <command>
[arguments]'.  It will look in the cmds/ directory for an executable
file with the name of the command, and execute it with the given
arguments if found.  The standard output of the command will be sent
to the channel.  While a command is being executed, $CMD_USER will be
the user that asked for the command, $CMD_ARGS will be the literal
command line arguments as a whitespace-preserved string, and $CMD_LINE
will be the full line, including command name.

Limitations
-----------

Mimir does not react well to unexpected occurences (it mostly ignores
them).  If its nick is already in use, or it is kicked from the
channel, it will make no attempt to recover.
